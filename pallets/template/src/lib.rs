//! # Direct Delegation
//! 
//! A pallet that aims to deliver a minimal viable working product of a system that lets people stake their funds to:
//! - Become a collator;
//! - Delegate to a collator;
//! - Join a delegator pool
//! 
//! //! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet provides functions to:
//! 
//! - Join a collator set as a candidate;
//! - Leave (requesting to leave) a collator set, removing oneself as a candidate;
//! - Delegating directly to a collator candidate.
//! - Withdraw unstaked after a wait period
//! - Join a delegator pool (ToDo)
//! 
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Candidate:** A user which locks up tokens to be included into the set of
//!   authorities which author blocks and receive rewards for doing so.
//!
//! - **Collator:** A candidate that was chosen to collate this round.
//!
//! - **Delegator:** A user which locks up tokens for collators they trust. When
//!   their collator authors a block, the corresponding delegators also receive
//!   rewards.
//!
//! - **Total Stake:** A collatorâ€™s own stake + the sum of delegated stake to
//!   this collator.
//!
//! - **Total collator stake:** The sum of tokens locked for staking from all
//!   collator candidates.
//!
//! - **Total delegator stake:** The sum of tokens locked for staking from all
//!   delegators.
//!
//! - **To Stake:** Lock tokens for staking.
//!
//! - **To Unstake:** Unlock tokens from staking.
//!
//! - **Round (= Session):** A fixed number of blocks in which the set of
//!   collators does not change. We set the length of a session to the length of
//!   a staking round, thus both words are interchangeable in the context of
//!   this pallet.
//!
//! - **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance
//!   until a specified block number. Multiple locks always operate over the
//!   same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack"
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//! 
//! - `set_inflation` - Change the inflation configuration. Requires sudo.
//! 
//! - `set_max_selected_candidates` - Change the number of collator candidates
//!   which can be selected to be in the set of block authors. Requires sudo.
//! 
//! - `set_blocks_per_round` - Change the number of blocks of a round. Shorter
//!   rounds enable more frequent changes of the selected candidates, earlier
//!   unlockal from unstaking and earlier collator leaving. Requires sudo.
//! 
//! - `join_candidates` - Join the set of collator candidates by staking at
//!   least `MinCandidateStake` and at most `MaxCollatorCandidateStake`.
//! 
//! - `init_leave_candidates` - Request to leave the set of collators. Unstaking
//!   and storage clean-up is delayed until executing the exit at least
//!   ExitQueueDelay rounds later.
//! 
//! - `candidate_stake_more` - Increase your own stake as a collator candidate
//!   by the provided amount up to `MaxCollatorCandidateStake`.
//! 
//! - `candidate_stake_less` - Decrease your own stake as a collator candidate
//!   by the provided amount down to `MinCandidateStake`.
//! 
//! - `join_delegators` - Join the set of delegators by delegating to a collator
//!   candidate.
//! 
//! - `delegate_another_candidate` - Delegate to another collator candidate by
//!   staking for them.
//! 
//! - `leave_delegators` - Leave the set of delegators and revoke all
//!   delegations. Since delegators do not have to run a node and cannot be
//!   selected to become block authors, this exit is not delayed like it is for
//!   collator candidates.
//! 
//! - `revoke_delegation` - Revoke a single delegation to a collator candidate.
//! - `delegator_stake_more` - Increase your own stake as a delegator and the
//!   delegated collator candidate's total stake.
//! 
//! - `delegator_stake_less` - Decrease your own stake as a delegator and the
//!   delegated collator candidate's total stake by the provided amount down to
//!   `MinDelegatorStake`.
//! 
//! - `unlock_unstaked` - Attempt to unlock previously unstaked balance from any
//!   account. Succeeds if at least one unstake call happened at least
//!   `StakeDuration` blocks ago.
//!
//! ## Genesis config
//!
//! Thisg pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`].
//!
//! ## Assumptions+
//!
//! - At the start of session s(i), the set of session ids for session s(i+1)
//!   are chosen. These equal the set of selected candidates. Thus, we cannot
//!   allow collators to leave at least until the start of session s(i+2).
//!
